Opening books and endgame tables seem like a good idea. But why not pre-analyzing moves with engines as deep as possible for the middlegame? 

We can't solve chess yet, but we can get partway there. That is the goal of this project--not to create a new chess engine, but to use existing
chess engines to analyze positions deeply, to 30-40 moves, and store the results of the analysis.

## future plans
I plan to build a client package for download that will be runnable so people can contribute to the project, with stats/tracking, similar to distributed.net.

Still need a way to deepen the analysis by looking at child nodes.
